    "In this project we solve the dynamic malthusian model. The model is from the course \"Economic History\" here at KU and it models preindustrial malthusian growth. In this model the parameters as defined as: \\\n",
    "$Y$ is production \\\n",
    "$L$ is labor/population \\\n",
    "$A$ is technology \\\n",
    "$X$ is land, which is constant, a core mechanism \\\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is defined by the three equations below, where 1. describe how output is a function of labor technology and land, where both land and technology is constant, a core assumption. Equation 2 describes how the population growthrate is positively correlated with income, by the parameter $\\eta$, another essenttial assumption. Equation 3 describes how population in the next period is given by the growthrate and the mortality rate. The model is then mean to describe how average income will be afected negatively by population growth and positively by moratality, as land and technology are set resources. \n",
