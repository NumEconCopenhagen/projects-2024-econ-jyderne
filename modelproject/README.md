# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **The dynamic malthus model** and is about the dynamic malthusian model which explains preindustrial economic growth. In this project we solve the model both analytically and numerically while adding the aspect of mortality in the model.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
